# Client libraries

These libraries allow your users to connect to Centrifugo from application frontend.

* [centrifuge-js](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-js) â€“ for browser, NodeJS and React Native.
* [centrifuge-go](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-go) - for Go language.
* [centrifuge-mobile](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-mobile) - for iOS and Android using `centrifuge-go` as basis and `gomobile` project to create bindings.
* [centrifuge-dart](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-dart) - for Dart and Flutter.

There are no native mobile clients at moment but hopefully this will change soon with open-source community help.
